    <h1>SPCAKK 6-Month Shelter Maintenance Fund Program.</h1>

    <div class="thefaq">
      <p>SPCA KK is a non-governmental organization (NGO) registered in 2006 in response to the need for animal welfare services in Kota Kinabalu. As a NGO, we are run solely by volunteers and rely entirely on public donations.</p>
      <p>Our current shelter in Lok Kawi houses over 200 rescued dogs and cats. Our monthly expense which include running costs, veterinary care and neutering programs is approximately RM20,000.00 per month.</p>
      <p>The lack of regular donations means that fundraising has to be done on a daily basis by our volunteers.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="myfaqs">How this program can help us</h3>

    <div class="thefaq">
      <p>By having a more regular income, it will allow us (the volunteers) to spend more time attending to cruelty and emergency cases such as abandonment of pets, road accident victims and inhumane treatment of pets, which occur on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Over the past 10 years, we have been working very hard to eradicate abuses & sufferings of animals by promoting humane treatment of animals, responsible pet ownership and law enforcement on act of cruelty. Our work also includes rescue, rehabilitation and re-homing of abused, injured, abandoned and sick animals. In the past 23 months (Jan 2014-Nov 2015) we have rescued 1058 dogs and cats and neutered more than 700 animals. The average number of animals successfully adopted is about 310 per year. Another important part of our work is to reduce the number of homeless animals on our streets by implementing the Trap-Neuter-Release (TNR) program.</p>
