    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions.</h1>

    <h3 class="myfaqs">1. Does SPCA KK receive stray dogs or cats?</h3>
    <div class="thefaq">
        <p>SPCA KK doesn’t receive stray dogs or cats unless the strays are in critical condition (e.g. severely injured, accidental cases, hit and run, hot water burns, abandoned puppies and kittens).  SPCA KK is in no position to accept all stray dogs &amp; cats simply because of the lack of resources to do so. It will also open the floodgate for pet owners to dump their unwanted animals instead of taking responsible action to stop their pets from reproducing.</p>
        <p><b>Fact:</b> Stray animals on the street today are the result of irresponsible pet owners who did not neuter their pets and allow uncontrolled breeding to take place.  Unwanted pets are abandoned and become stray animals in our society.  Therefore, we encourage all pet owners to SPAY and NEUTER their pets to help to minimize stray animal over-population.</p>
        <p>Statistic shows that if two dogs and their offspring are allowed to reproduce freely,there can be an addition of 2,048 dogs in their city in just 4 years. In similar time span, two cats will lead to a staggering 20,736 number of cats.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="myfaqs">2. We have too many dogs (or cats) at home, would you take some/all of them?</h3>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <p>SPCA KK does not have the space or the money to shelter so many animals. So what you can do to help is to first neuter your pets and then consider one of the following options:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>to ask friends and relatives if they can adopt the animals.</li><br/>
        <li>to put up an adoption ad on your Facebook.</li><br/>
        <li>to join our animal adoption event which is held at a shopping mall once a month.<br/>However, if the animals are not adopted, you need to take them back until our next adoption drive.</li><br/>
        <li>try to post an ad on <a href="http://www.petfinder.my" target="_blank">http://www.petfinder.my</a>  where members of the public go to look for pets – but please ensure you screen potential adopters thoroughly. You may seek advice from SPCAKK on screening procedures.</li><br/>
        <li>to surrender your pets to SPCA KK must be your last resort (refer to animal surrender procedures) – please try to re-home them with your friends, family or colleagues first.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Procedure for surrendering your pet(s):
        <ol>
          <li>To fill in the necessary details on surrender form and pay surrender fee.  By signing the form, you transfer ownership of the animal(s) to SPCA KK, and you cannot reclaim the animal later. Please think the decision over to surrender your pet through thoroughly before surrendering it here.</li><br/>
          <li>If you require assistance in transportation of the animal, please call SPCA KK hotline on 019-8809660 during office hours. Charges will be applied.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>We therefore appeal to owners and finders to take on the responsibility of finding a new home for the animal they cannot keep. Every animal re-homed by an owner or member of the public without having to come through our doors means an extra space in our shelter for more critical cases.   It is easier for you to find a home for <b>one</b> animal than it is for us to find a home for <b>hundreds</b> of animals. With your help, we can free up more resources to help more sick and abused animals with urgent needs.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="myfaqs">3. What do we do with injured stray animals in car accidents, bad skin problems, blindness, or in life threatening situations?</h3>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <ol>
        <li>Call the SPCA KK hotline 019-8809660 and provide details such as the condition of the animal, address of the location, your name and your contact number. Please stay with the animal until our arrival.  We will dispatch our animal rescue volunteer(s) to your location as soon as possible. Very often, if there is no one keeping an eye on the animal, the animal may move away from the location you spotted it.  Under these circumstances, the rescue officer may not be able to find the injured animals when they arrive at the scene.  This will be a waste of time and resources of our rescue team.</li><br/>
        <li>You may help by bringing the animal to a safer location (e.g. away from traffic, off a crowded area) and confine it (in a box or carrier etc). If you are unable to do so, please stay with the animal until our arrival.</li><br/>
        <li>If possible, you can help the animal yourself by taking the animal to the nearest veterinarian and we will attend to the case as soon as possible.</li>

    <div class="thefaq">
      <p>If you witness an act of deliberate cruelty (resulting in injury or death) or abandonment of an animal you can take the following steps:</p>
      <ol>

        <li>You may make a report at Jabatan Perkhidmatan Haiwan or police station. SPCAKK's inspectorate will look into the case and where possible, bring in the authorities such as Wildlife Department, DBKK etc. In serious cases, a police report will be made and the offenders may face a penalty.

      <p>Refer to question No.2 above.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="myfaqs">13. I found a newborn/ young kitten/puppy. What should I do?</h3>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <p>Sometimes you may come across a litter of kittens/pups huddled under the building stairs, in a playground, in an abandoned building etc.  Please do the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Be patient and monitor them for several hours to see if their mother comes back – mother cats/dogs have to leave their litter to search for food and water several times a day. If you or someone you know can foster them, please take the young ones in together with their mother - as they stand a much higher chance of surviving with their mothers’ milk and care.  However if you observe that the mother dog/cat has not returned the whole day, or if the pups/kittens look like they have been abandoned for a few days (judging from their poor hydration, dirty condition of their fur, etc) please do pick them up and either foster them yourself or find them a foster home - as they will not survive out there on their own.</li><br/>
          <li>Call SPCAKK hotline 019-8809660 for further advice.</li>
        </ol>

Unfortunately, SPCAKK does not have the space or the money to shelter so many animals. So what you can do to help is to sterilize your pet and encourage other pet owners to do the same.

          <li>Pet Population Control<br /><br />
            Thousands of stray animals in our society is the result of the uncontrolled pet breeding and abandonment of unwanted pets.  Thousands of these stray animals are suffering on the streets from diseases and human cruelty. Many of them will be euthanized, poisoned or killed by other means when the population becomes out of control and become a nuisance. By neutering your pets you can help effectively to reduce the population of stray animals and hence the unnecessarily suffering of stray animals.
