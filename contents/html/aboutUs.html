  <h1>About SPCA Kota Kinabalu</h1>
  <p>The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Kota Kinabalu (SPCA KK) is a non govermental organisation registered with the Registry of Societies, Malaysia since 14th February 2006. A group of animal lovers who had been working independently for strays got together to be stronger and more effective.</p>

  <p>Since its inception, our volunteers and staff have been involved in many areas of animal welfare to create awareness on the importance of neutering, adoption, responsible pet ownership, and lobbying authorities for strict enforcement of Animal Welfare Enactment 2015 against abuse and cruelty.</p>

  <p>SPCA KK's nomadic existence ended with Datin Chow's donation of 4.5-acre piece of land in Papar enabled a shelter to be built. Other donors came forward to help make the shelter what it is today.</p>
