  <h1>About SPCA Kota Kinabalu</h1>
  <p>The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Kota Kinabalu (SPCA KK) is a non govermental organisation which has been registered with the Registry of Societies, Malaysia since the 14th February 2006. A group of animal lovers who had been working independently for the welfare of strays and abused animals in Kota Kinabalu had decided to form a common platform so that their work can be done more effectively.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the society is to promote a better understanding on the  needs, and rights of animals in order to reduce the incidences of animal abuses.</p>

  <p>To date, the main effort of SPCA KK has been on educating the public on responsible pet ownership, inspectorate, rescue and rehoming after vaccination and desexing.</p>

  <p>The rescued animals which included puppies and kittens are currently being cared for in a temporary shelter, which sadly, has shifted three times between 2012 and 2015 for lack of a proper venue.</p>

  <p>We have recently been given a 4.5 acres piece of land in the district of Papar by a generous benefactor to construct a rehabilitation and adoption centre.</p>

  <p>The plans for the construction of the centre has been approved by the district council on the 7 Sept 2015 and we are now in the process of raising funds to begin construction.</p>

  <p>The societyâ€™s work has so far been supported solely by donations from the general public.</p>

  <p>The successful completion of this centre will depend on further support from caring members in the community. Donations either in cash or in kind will be very helpful.</p>
